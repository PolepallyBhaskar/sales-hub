# Sales Management Application

This repository contains the client-side (Angular) and server-side (Node.js and PostgreSQL) implementations for a Sales Management System. The client-side handles the user interface for managing products and orders, while the server-side handles the backend logic and database operations.

## Documentation

To make it easier for you to understand and set up both parts of the project, we have split the documentation into two separate sections: **Client** and **Backend**.

- [Client Documentation](client.md): Describes how to set up and run the client-side Angular application.
- [Backend Documentation](backend.md): Describes how to set up and run the server-side Node.js application with PostgreSQL.

Please refer to the respective files for detailed setup and instructions.
